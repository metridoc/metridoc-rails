%hr
%h3 How is the active population defined?
The active faculty and staff population is defined by users belonging to a school with an Alma user_group of "Faculty", "Faculty Express", "Staff", or "Library Staff".  
See parent page for a description of how the school affiliation is evaluated.

%h3 How is the total population defined?
The total faculty and staff population is extracted from the IR&A Quick Facts.
Specifically the "Regular Faculty & Staff Total" numbers associated with each school.
This total is the sum of all "Standing Faculty", "Associated Faculty", and "Regular Staff, Academic Support Staff, and Other Instructional Staff".

%h3 What other context is needed?
%ul
  %li If no data exists for a given school and a library, there will not be a plot below.
  %li 
    Due to the difference in definitions between IRA and Alma (extracted from Penn's Data Warehouse), not all Alma faculty will be represented in the IR&A data and vice versa.
    However, the comparison should remain consistent even if the precise data is inaccurate.
  %li The Vet Library at the New Bolton Center (NBC) only uses swipe access during off-hours.
