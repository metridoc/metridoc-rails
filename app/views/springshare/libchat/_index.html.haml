      Springshare's #{link_to "LibChat", "https://www.springshare.com/libanswers/"}
      widgets are a full-featured chat system to bring library reference to any webpage.  
      All times will show up in the interface in coordinated universal 
      time (UTC).  There is no API for the chat database. The expected refresh 
      of the data is monthly manual uploads.
      %br
      #{link_to "InquiryMap", "#inquirymap"} is an automated tagging process designed to tag 
      LibChat data with content, sentiment, and affiliation tags.
      We assign these tags for the purpose of identifying trends in the chat 
      questions over time, including, but not limited to: 
      %ul
        %li what types of questions are being asked 
        %li the number of chats resulting in tickets
        %li the rate of user satisfaction
        %li the groups of users encountering specific problems

      We welcome feedback on our dashboards and schema. If you have any suggestions 
      (or to share something cool you discovered) please fill out our

  %h2{id: "inquirymap"} InquiryMap Analysis 
  InquiryMap is a service designed to enhance the library chat data with 
  automatically labelled content, sentiment, and affiliation tags.
  %br
  The content tags arise from a schema of 7 main categories and 24 
  subcategories derived by UX Researcher Virshae Campbell and 
  Bollinger Fellow in Innovation Angelica Rivera. 
  The first 4 categories are from hand-scanning chats and frequently 
  searched terms from the library website. 
  The last 3 categories were created to capture as many of the 
  remaining chats as possible. 
  These categories and numbers were derived from the 1,924 LibChat
  interactions from 05/01/2023-05/31/2024.
  %br
  Testing the original sample, 77% of the interactions are labelled 
  through keywords,  13% are missed due to typos and capitalization, 
  but otherwise match the schema, and 10% contain miscellaneous requests.
  %p{:style => "font-weight: 700; display: inline"} 
    Up to 90% of incoming chats can be labelled with the schema.
  The subcategories are assigned by themes found inside the categories.

  %p{:style => "font-weight: 700;"} TODO: This image needs to be UPDATED!
  %figure{:style => "text-align: center; max-width: 1000px; width: 100%; margin: auto; padding: 0px 0px;"}
    %figcaption Schema for assigning categories and subcategories with InquiryMap.
    =image_tag asset_path("SpringshareInquiryMapSchema.png"), :alt => "Image of InquiryMap Schema", :width => "100%", :title => "InquiryMap Schema"

  %center 
    Below is an example of how InquiryMap can be used to extract details 
    about a chat without reading the text. 
    Given the following codes:
    %table.data_summary
      %tbody
        %tr
          %th Column Name
          %th Medium
          %th Purpose of Search
          %th Services
          %th Account_Q
          %th Top_Searches
          %th Subscriptions
          %th Newspaper
        %tr
          %th Flag Value
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 0
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 1
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 2
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 1
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 2
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 2
          %td{style: "text-align: right;"} 0

  Reversing the tagging schema, this question is about research or from a researcher 
  about an account for a subscription service that involves citations.

  Here is the redacted user question:
  %blockquote
    I would like to gain access to the premium features on Web of Science
    (e.g. search all citations of a paper). As a CHOP researcher, working under 
    ****, I have access to Penn Libraries. Do I also have access to the Web of 
    Science features? If so can you help me set that up or access them? 
    I have already added my chop email to my Web of Science account but I 
    am not sure how to go from there (it looks like I still have the free account).
    Thanks!

  The user issues are captured in a handful of numbers and maintains 
  the patron's privacy.

  %h2{id: "sentiment"} Sentiment Analysis

  A sentiment score for each user chat is calculated using the sentiment analysis package 
  #{link_to "VADER", "https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment"}.
  VADER is trained on social media posts, with a human-assigned lexicon 
  designed to handle colloquial input such as emojis and internet 
  shorthand (such as “lol”). 
  It is also capable of recognizing mixed sentiment in a single sentence.
  %br 
  A sentiment score is calculated for each patron message then averaged 
  to a final sentiment score for the entire interaction.
  Previous studies have shown that the sentiments aligned with manual scoring (83% accuracy) 
  and correlate well with the success rate of the chat.
  Success is defined as the Patron receiving either the answer to the question or a referral for further assistance. 
  Chats in the positive and ecstatic categories for the sample examined had success rates of 91% and 95%, respectively.
  Neutral chats may also be successful, but the patron interaction could be too short to evaluate the sentiment accurately.
  %br
  %br
  The sentiment scores represent the following categories:

  %ul
    %li Negative: -1 < x < -0.05
    %li Neutral: -0.05 < x < 0.05 
    %li Positive: 0.05 < x < 0.3
    %li Ecstatic: 0.3 < x < 1
