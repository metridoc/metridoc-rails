  %h2="Introduction"

  This page is devoted to analysis of trends in the libchats. This includes the use of a predetermined list of codes to capture the meaning of the initial chat questions. The schema of the categories is as follows:

  INSERT TABLE WITH SCHEMA HERE! Or link to pdf!

  Here is an example of how this is useful. Given the following codes:

  %section

  %h2{style: "text-align:center;"}

  %table{align: "center", border: "1", cellpadding: "5"}
    %thead
      %tr
        %td Code Type
        %td{:align => "center"}="Medium"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Purpose of Search"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Services"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Account_Q"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Top_Searches"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Subscriptions"
        %td{:align => "center"}="Newspaper"
  
    %tbody
      %tr
        %td Flag Type
        %td{:align => "center"}="0"
        %td{:align => "center"}="1"
        %td{:align => "center"}="2"
        %td{:align => "center"}="1"
        %td{:align => "center"}="2"
        %td{:align => "center"}="2"
        %td{:align => "center"}="False"

  One might assume that the question is about %strong research or from a researcher about an account for a subscription service that involves citations.

  Here is the actual user question:

  "I would like to gain access to the premium features on Web of Science (e.g. search all citations of a paper). As a CHOP researcher, working under ****, I have access to Penn Libraries. Do I also have access to the Web of Science features? If so can you help me set that up or access them? I have already added my chop email to my Web of Science account but I am not sure how to go from there (it looks like I still have the free account). Thanks!"

  Beyond capturing the problems the user is seeking solutions to in a handful of numbers, this flagging technique solves issues of privacy (i.e.-one does not need to look at the raw chat question to understand what the user is asking). Follow-up work will be done to try to capture: the topics that arise over the course of the full transcript (i.e.-common solutions to problems).

  %li
    %strong The Demographics page:
    This page emphasizes the following variables:
  
    Demographics: whether the user is a student, faculty member, alum, or visitor (indicated by true/false columns).

    Categories of questions: breakdown of subcategories relative to their main category.
  
    Referrer/Widget: how the libchat user was directed to the libchat.
  %li
    %strong The "Sentiment" page:
    This page is devoted to determining whether the chat was useful to the user or not. This page emphasizes the following variables:
  
    Sentiment score: as explained above.

    Length of chat: measured in time or in number of messages back and forth.

    Number of chats resulting in tickets.

    We have obtained a "sentiment score" using the sentiment analysis package VADER (LINK!). Through studies our team enacted (see schema documentation above) we found that the sentiments aligned well with how we would score them (83% accuracy)and in general correlate well with success rate (positive and ecstatic categories having a success rate of 91% and 95%, respectively). We quantify "success" as the user having received the answer to their question or that they have been referred to someone who can help them further. In general, the scores represent the following categories:

    sentiment score less than -0.05: negative

    sentiment score greater than -0.05 and less than 0.05: neutral

    sentiment score greator than 0.05 and less than 0.3: positive

    sentiment score greater than 0.3: ecstatic

    Some disclaimers are necessary: it doesn't tell us information about every interaction (i.e.-the student might just leave the chat after receiving an answer, may become disconnected, etc.) We therefore emphasize that %strong a neutral value should not be taken to be a negative or unsuccessful interaction.

  %li
    %strong The Statistics page
    contains trends in the libchat data captured in tabular and plot format for the past five years. This includes such quantities as changes in the types of chats being asked, populations asking the questions, number of chats per year, number of chats per day of the week, how people are finding the chat, and the number of chats resulting in tickets.

  %li
    %strong Plot Details:
    For any plot with a legend you may click on a label(/s) to eliminate that data from the plot, showing only the data groups that remain. If you pan your cursor over a plotting element (such as a point or a bar) the value of that element will be displayed.

  User and librarian identities are disaggregated from all of the current qualities and will also be kept separate from any future additions.

    %strong Covid-19:
    From April 2020 through July 2022 there were closures/restrictions on the libraries due to COVID. 
  %li
    %strong Deduplication:
    Note that it is possible that there exist consecutive chats from an individual, sometimes the chat is interupted due to connectivity issues.
